# Real World Test: [Material Designer Frontend/UX](https://github.com/exabyte-io/rewotes/blob/master/materials-designer.md)

This is a starting approach for 'Material Designer' problem, stated in [_Exabyte-io/rewotes_](https://github.com/exabyte-io/rewotes)

The APP is prepared to make an HTTP request to an API which serve the required materials data.
Due to the fact that there is not yet an API url defined, the APP then renders a mockData.js file.

# Functionalities

Users can be able to update the graphical view as they the data in the `input` fields of the left panel.

## @todo

Allow users to:

- _zoom_ in/out the graphical view
- _rotate_ the graphical view
- _add_ new atoms
- _remove_ atoms

# To run the APP

Open a terminal/bash window at the roor folder, install dependencies:

```
  $ yarn
  ... installing dependencies
  ...
  ... success installing dependencies
```

then, run the APP:

```
  $ yarn start
```
